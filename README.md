# Admission-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-
Programming Language : Python

We have Created 4 ML models to predict the ‘Chance of Admit’ with minimum MSE, RMSE and maximum R-Square score of the dataset containing several features which are considered important during the applications for Masters Programs.

The features included are : 

1.	GRE Scores ( out of 340 )
2.	TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 )
3.	University Rating ( out of 5 )
4.	Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength ( out of 5 )
5.	Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 )
6.	Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 )
7.	Chance of Admit ( ranging from 0 to 1 )
 
The 4 models are:

1.	Multiple Linear Regressor (MLR)
2.	Random Forest Regressor (RFR)
3.	MLR with PCA
4.	RFR with PCA
